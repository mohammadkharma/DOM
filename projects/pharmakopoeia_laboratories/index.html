                    <p>We are involved in researching the latest laboratory tests that enhance the personalised medicine
                        programmes carried out at our clinics. These include genetic tests, intestinal permeability,
                        microbiology, virology, microbiome dysbiosis, in addition to the latest inflammatory markers.
                        These tests are then incorporated into our clinics by first assessing their relevance in an
                        inflammatory clinical setting</p>

                        developed vaccine delivery systems that strengthen immunity responses against HIV as part of the
                        Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
                        Haytham completed his post doctoral training at Oxford University at the department of clinical

                        Haytham then set up a team of investigators at Oxford University, at the department of oncology
                        on behalf of a Swiss phyto-pharmaceutical Biotech company, to screen herbal extracts for their
                        immune modulating effects.
                        In 2012 Haytham has applied his translational Medicine training to develop integrated medicine
                        protocols for a clinic in the ME region. In 2013 Haytham co-founded with his wife Dr Abigail
                        their first integrated medicine clinic in Oxfordshire. And then moved to London and setup
